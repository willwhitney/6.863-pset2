A few notes about this submission:

randsent-argparse is the first version of randsent that I wrote, which uses argparse, a python 2.7 library. I rewrote it in randsent to use optparse, which works on older versions of python.

Sample outputs from all the grammars in included in output.txt.

The writeup, as you might guess, is in assignment2_writeup.pdf.

All the grammars are included under the appropriate names.
