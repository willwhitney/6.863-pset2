# This grammar uses a convention that
#		- terminals are lowercase					(president)
#		- preterminals are capitalized		 (Noun)
#		- other nonterminals are all-caps	(NP)
# 
# This convention just makes grammars more readable to humans.	Thus:
#
#		- When *you* are writing grammars in questions 3 and 6, you should 
#			follow this convention unless you have a good reason not to.	
#
#		- But your *program* should still work with grammars that don't 
#			follow this convention.	It should not pay any attention to
#			upper/lower case.	From your program's point of view, 
#			if there is at least one rule for rewriting a symbol, then
#			that symbol is a nonterminal and should be rewritten.

# Vocabulary.	Your program can see that "ate" is a terminal
# symbol because there exists no rule for rewriting it.
# Any symbol that can rewrite as a terminal (or a string of 
# terminals, like "chief of staff") is called a "preterminal."	Notice 
# that a preterminal is a special kind of nonterminal.
